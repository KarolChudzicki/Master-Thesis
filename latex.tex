A paper ... proposes a visual servo control alogorithm to estimate a positon of
a moving object. Instead of using position based control for the project which relies on
precise models of the camera and the robot, authors propose a image based control which
caluculate the error and postion of the object basing only on the information from the camera
plane. (maybe explain it more) This approach eliminates the errors from robot and camera models.
To further improve the reliability of their system, reaserchers used Kalman filter to
enhance pose estimation. The results demonstrated that the incorrect or inaccurate data
from a camera due to it's 

% Note
Try implementing image based control and position based control and determine which is better
maybe the image based control is enough?
